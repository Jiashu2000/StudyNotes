# Data Warehouse

### 1. What is data warehousing, and how does it differ from a traditional database?

Data warehousing is the process of collecting, storing, and managing data from various sources in a centralized repository. The goal of data warehousing is to provide a unified view of the data, making it easier to analyze and derive insights that can inform business decisions.

A traditional database is designed for operational purposes, such as managing transactions or running applications. It is typically optimized for read/write performance, and the data is organized in a way that reflects the current state of the business.

Data warehousing is optimized for reporting and analysis. The data is organized in a way that makes it easier to query and analyze, with a focus on historical data rather than real-time updates. The data in a data warehouse is typically pre-processed, cleaned, and transformed to ensure consistency and accuracy, making it easier to analyze and derive insights.

Data warehousing also involves the use of specialized tools and technologies, such as ETL (extract, transform, load) pipelines, OLAP (online analytical processing) databases, and business intelligence (BI) tools. 

Overall, the main difference between a traditional database and a data warehouse is their purpose and focus. A traditional database is designed for operational purposes, while a data warehouse is designed for analytical purposes,
