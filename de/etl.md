# ETL

### 1. What is the ETL pipeline?

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. An ETL pipeline is a set of processes used to extract data from various sources, transform it to fit the desired structure and format, and then load it into a target database or data warehouse for analysis.

The ETL process typically begins with data extraction, where data is collected from various sources such as databases, flat files, APIs, or web scraping tools.

The ETL pipeline is often automated, with scheduled runs to ensure that the data is updated and available in a timely manner.
