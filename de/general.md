- What is Data Engineering? Explain in detail.

Data engineering is the process of designing, building, and maintaining systems that collect store, process, and transform data into useful information. This involves working with large volumes of data from various sources, such as databases, applications, and sensors, and making it accessible and usable by other applications and users.

A data engineer’s job is to ensure that data is collected and processed efficiently, reliably, and securely. They design and implement data pipelines that transform raw data into structured and organized formats that can be used for analysis and decision-making. They also ensure that data is stored in a way that is easily accessible and can be queried efficiently.

- What are the three main types of Big Data in data engineering, and how are they different from each other?

    1. Structured Data

        This type of data has a well-defined structure, meaning that it is organized in a consistent format, such as a table with columns and rows. Structured data is typically found in relational databases, spreadsheets, and other tabular formats
    
    2. Unstructured Data

        This type of data does not have a pre-defined structure, meaning that it can take many different formats and is often difficult to organize. Unstructured data includes things like text documents, images, videos, and social media posts.

    3. Semi-Structured Data

        This type of data has some structure but is not as well-defined as structured data. Semi-structured data often has a schema that describes the data’s structure, but the actual data may not conform to the schema completely. Example: XML or JSON data, where there may be nested elements that are not easily represented in a tabular format.
