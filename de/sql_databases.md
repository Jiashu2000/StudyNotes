##  Pros and cons of using SQL databases

- ACID properties and consistency

    SQL databases adhere to the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which ensure the reliability of transactions and the consistency of the data. These properties guarantee that any operation on the data will either be completed in its entirety or not at all, and that the data will always remain in a consistent state.

    - Atomicity
    
        Atomicity is a property that ensures that a database follows the all or nothing rule. In other words, the database considers all transaction operations as one whole unit or atom.

        Thus, when a database processes a transaction, it is either fully completed or not executed at all. If a single portion of the transaction fails, the whole transaction will fail.

        For example, user A wants to withdraw $50 from his account and then transfer it to the account of user B. Each transaction (withdrawing $50 from account A and transferring $50 to account B) is counted as separate. If the first transaction (withdrawing $50) fails because (say) the server crashes during the transaction, user A cannot transfer the money to user B.

    - Consistency

        Consistency is a property ensuring that only valid data following all rules and constraints is written in the database. When a transaction results in invalid data, the database reverts to its previous state, which abides by all customary rules and constraints.

        Consistency is key to maintain data integrity. All inconsistent data is discarded, and all transactions that might cause an inconsistency are aborted and an error is created or transcribed into an error log.

        For example, if user A wants to withdraw $1,000 from his account, but only has a balance of $500, consistency will prevent him from withdrawing money and the transaction will be aborted.

    - Isolation

        Isolation is a property that guarantees the individuality of each transaction, and prevents them from being affected from other transactions. It ensures that transactions are securely and independently processed at the same time without interference, but it does not ensure the order of transactions.

        For example, user A withdraws $100 and user B withdraws $250 from user Z’s account, which has a balance of $1,000. Since both A and B draw from Z’s account, one of the users is required to wait until the other user transaction is completed, avoiding inconsistent data.

        If B is required to wait, then B must wait until A’s transaction is completed, and Z’s account balance changes to $900. Now, B can withdraw $250 from this $900 balance.

    - Durability

        Durability is a property that enforces completed transactions, guaranteeing that once each one of them has been committed, it will remain in the system even in case of subsequent failures.

        If a transaction is successful, all changes generated by it are stored permanently.

- Structured schema

    SQL databases enforce a predefined schema for the data, which ensures that the data is structured, consistent, and follows specific rules. This structured schema can make it easier to understand and maintain the data model, as well as optimize queries for performance.

- Query language and optimization: 

    SQL is a powerful and expressive query language that allows developers to perform complex operations on the data, such as filtering, sorting, grouping, and joining multiple tables based on specified conditions. SQL databases also include query optimizers, which analyze and optimize queries for improved performance.

- Scalability and performance: 

    SQL databases can be scaled vertically by adding more resources (such as CPU, memory, and storage) to a single server. However, horizontal scaling, or distributing the data across multiple servers, can be more challenging due to the relational nature of the data and the constraints imposed by the ACID properties. This can lead to performance bottlenecks and difficulties in scaling for large-scale applications with high write loads or massive amounts of data.
