# Table Partitioning

- Notice that the table wildcard * used in the FROM clause to limit the amount of tables referred to in the TABLE_SUFFIX filter.

``` SQL
 SELECT
   DATE(CAST(year AS INT64), CAST(mo AS INT64), CAST(da AS INT64)) AS date,
   (SELECT ANY_VALUE(name) FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS stations
    WHERE stations.usaf = stn) AS station_name,  -- Stations may have multiple names
   prcp
 FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` AS weather
 WHERE prcp < 99.9  -- Filter unknown values
   AND length(_TABLE_SUFFIX) = 4 AND CAST(_TABLE_SUFFIX AS int64) >= 2018
   AND prcp > 0      -- Filter stations/days with no precipitation
   AND CAST(_TABLE_SUFFIX AS int64) >= 2018
 ORDER BY date DESC -- Where has it rained/snowed recently
 LIMIT 10
```

``` sql
#standardSQL
 CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ecommerce.days_with_rain
 PARTITION BY date
 OPTIONS (
   partition_expiration_days=60,
   description="weather stations with precipitation, partitioned by day"
 ) AS
 SELECT
   DATE(CAST(year AS INT64), CAST(mo AS INT64), CAST(da AS INT64)) AS date,
   (SELECT ANY_VALUE(name) FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS stations
    WHERE stations.usaf = stn) AS station_name,  -- Stations may have multiple names
   prcp
 FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` AS weather
 WHERE prcp < 99.9  -- Filter unknown values
   AND length(_TABLE_SUFFIX) = 4 AND CAST(_TABLE_SUFFIX AS int64) >= 2018
   AND prcp > 0      -- Filter
   AND CAST(_TABLE_SUFFIX AS int64) >= 2018

```

- Use Union Wildcards to treat multiple tables as a single group
